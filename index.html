      <p>
        I'm a computer programmer, wannabe designer, game player, and music
        lover.  In my free time, I like to make things. Below is an abridged
        list of some of the cool things I've created or contributed to.

      <p>
        I love learning new programming languages, and I had an absolute blast
        making one!  LatteScript is an educational programming language and
        environment for use in web browsers. The syntax was inspired by Pascal
        and Python, and it was designed to be as minimal as possible for ease
        of learning.
        <a href="http://lattescript.mockbrian.com/">You can try it out here</a>.
        I have blogged extensively about its development at
        <a href="http://lattescript.blogspot.com/"> the LatteScript blog</a>.
        The
        <a href="https://github.com/saikobee/lattescript/">source code is on GitHub</a>.
      </p>

<code>procedure bubble_sort xs
  swapped := true
  while swapped
    swapped := false
    for i from 2 to #xs
      if xs@(i - 1) &lt; xs@i
        swap xs, i - 1, i
        swapped := true

procedure swap xs, i, j
  temp := xs@i
  xs@i := xs@j
  xs@j := temp

xs := [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
bubble_sort xs
print xs</code>

      <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/algebra-card-clutter/id549330499"
      >Algebra Card Clutter</a></h3>
      <p>
        I co-developed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/algebra-card-clutter/id549330499"
        >Algebra Card Clutter</a>
        for the <a href="http://www.algebraicthinking.org/"
        >Center for Algebraic Thinking</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were given a roughly two-sentence description of what the card game
        was like, and wrote a proposal about how we envisioned the game and how
        long we expected development to take.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is a card game where you sort a deck of expressions without
        having to actually calculate the values. It helps develop quick
        mathematical reasoning about the relative sizes of various expressions,
        such as fractions, square roots, and exponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created all the levels, all the art, and programmed the entire app
        from scratch in around a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is available for free on the App Store, only on iPad.

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/pypixel"
      >pypixel</a></h3>
      <p>
        I learned programming using the graphics API in QBasic. It was
        extremely simple, but perfect for a beginning programmer. Obviously
        QBasic is of little use to a modern-day programmer, so I decided to
        create a library for Python in the same spirit as QBasic graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spoke about this project at the SuperQuest Spring Conference in 2011.
        You can watch a video of my presentation on
        <a href="http://vimeo.com/20999218"
        >Vimeo</a>.
      </p>

<code>from pypixel import *
show()
circle(RED, (WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2), HEIGHT/2)
update()
pause()</code>

      <p>
        Compare this what is actually being abstracted away from the underlying
        <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html"
        >PyGame</a> library:
      </p>

<code>import pygame
SIZE  = (640, 480)
OPTS  = pygame.DOUBLEBUF | pygame.HWSURFACE
FPS   = 60
TITLE = 'Hello, world!'

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(SIZE, OPTS)
pygame.mouse.set_visible(False)
pygame.display.set_caption(TITLE)
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

pygame.draw.circle(
  pygame.display.get_surface(),
  pygame.Color(255, 0, 0),
  (WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2),
  HEIGHT/2
)

for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.locals.QUIT:
        exit()
    elif event.type == pygame.locals.KEYDOWN:
        # TODO: Handle various keys:
        # - fullscreen toggling
        # - escape to quit
        # - etc.

    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(FPS)</code>

        And here's a more interesting example of something drawn using pypixel.

        I love making things look nice. I've written numerous themes for Linux,
