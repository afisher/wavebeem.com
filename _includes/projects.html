    <h2>Algebra Card Clutter</h2>
    <p>
        I worked a two person contract making an educational math
        game for middle school kids. We were given a rough two
        sentence proposal for the app as a starting point, from
        which we designed the screens of the game, the art assets,
        and the code.

        It consolidates
        information from the 13th Age core rulebook into terse
        tables and provides a few buttons to modify statistics so
        players can create optimal builds easily without
        accidentally breaking the rules.
