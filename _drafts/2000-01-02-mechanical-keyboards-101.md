## Introduction

Hey there, fellow human! I bet you're reading this because you're curious what all the fuss is about mechanical keyboards lately. Maybe your friend has one and you are kinda interested in getting your own, but don't know where to start. The good news is, it's not just you, it is a little confusing to find the right keyboard for you. In fact, I'm still learning new things about keyboards all the time.

## Why

You might be wondering _why_ you should get a mechanical keyboard. Well, I think the single most important reason is they feel nicer to type on. Granted, this is extremely subjective, and people adapt pretty well to different devices given enough time, so take it with a grain of salt.

I am a software developer and avid Twitter user, so I spend a huge chunk of my day typing on computer keyboards, so I figure it's worth it for myself to invest the money in getting the best tools for doing the job.

In addition, mechanical keyboards tend to be pretty easily customizable compared to traditional keyboards, like changing out keycaps for a new look, or often even changing aspects of keyboard key layouts.

## Why not

It's not all perfect in mechanical keyboard land, though. For one thing, mechanical keyboards tend to be quite a lot more expensive than traditional keyboards, and are almost never wireless.

And the real elephant in the room is that mechanical keyboards are often a good bit louder, which can be a problem for office environments. Under the switch types section I will discuss more about noise and respect for your neighbors.

Finally, you may want to be careful getting into the hobby because there are so many cool keyboards to try out, you just might find yourself spending a lot of money just to get things that look cool. I currently have more keyboards than I do computers.

## Keyboard form factors

Full size keyboards are the classic size many people are used to seeing. The typically have around 104 keys, including a numpad and arrow keys. You definitely won't have any problems typing on this form factor, but it means you have to move your right hand really far to access your mouse or touchpad. I personally almost never used the numpad even though it's faster for number inputs, just because I don't type a lot of long numbers. I imagine folks who use Excel all day might have a different thought here (more on numpads in a few paragraphs).

Tenkeyless (TKL) keyboards typically have around 87 keys, including arrow keys but discarding the numpad area. This is usually about as many keys as a laptop has, so this might be the most familiar form factor for you to get started with. I think it's hard to go wrong with a TKL board since it makes few compromises.

So-called 75% keyboards are called this because they typically have about 75% as many keys as a full size board. Usually these keyboards do have arrow keys, but have smaller Right Shift keys. Often the Page Up/Page Down/Home/End keys are arranged vertically in a strip on the right side of the keyboard.

Missing keys such as Print Screen or Pause are typically accessed by holding down the Function (Fn) key to right of Right Alt and pressing another one.

These keyboards are closest in size to a 13" laptop keyboard, freeing up plenty of desk space and keeping your hand even closer to the mouse or keyboard.

60% keyboards typically are missing the F1-F12 key strip along the top, generally opting for holding down the Fn key to access the numerous missing keys. Some 60% keyboards even omit the arrow keys, generally opting for Fn+IJKL as a replacement arrow key cluster.

Many of these keyboards also offer media and volume keys by holding Fn and pressing other keys on the keyboard. Often this is the F1-F12 keys at the top, but some more ergonomic layouts have media/volume key clusters that can be accessed using one hand.

I would recommend looking into either a TKL or 75% keyboard to get started with, but more advanced users may be interested in split and/or ortholinear (ortho) keyboards which have various unique layouts in order to help with typing ergonomics, but which are quite foreign and take time to get used to.

## Keyboard form factor extras

Additionally, you may want to consider keyboard angle. Having a very high angled keyboard strains your fingers more. Try miming a typing action with your fingers angled up compared with down and you'll see how much more exhausting it is. Many keyboards are naturally sloped and deploying keyboard feet only makes them even more sloped, furthering finger fatigue.

Most keyboards come with black plastic cases, and hopefully a matte finish. You might also find some in white plastic, or even aluminum. You should pick whichever material you think will look nicest on your desk, but note that if the keys are mounted directly on metal with no plastic in-between, you can have a slight metallic clang when fully pressing a key.

LEDs are also a topic of great interest for some folks. I generally type without looking at the keyboard, so I regard them mostly as a fun addition of color to my desk and not a typing aid. Many mechanical keyboards do not come with LEDs and have no support for them, so know that you're going to have limited options if you want LEDs. Generally "gaming keyboards" have these, so you may want to look there if it's important to you.

## Keyboard switch types

Most keyboard switches (keyswitches) are made by Cherry and are part of the MX family. There exist many new manufacturers, but I won't get into them here today. The primary differences between these types are the strength of the spring inside the switch, affecting how much force (measured in g=grams) is required to press the switch, and also the "track" the key switch follows along the way, which may have bumps or other affects to give you physical feedback while typing.

Also note that all Cherry keyswitches activate before the reach the bottom of the spring (bottoming out). It is generally recommend to avoiding bottoming out when typing if possible since it is wasted effort and will make your typing louder, but I can personally say this is a hard habit to break.

Clicky switches are the classic style that is probably most well-known. Clicky switches are known for their somewhat high pitched clicking noise produced when activating the switch. This gives amazing feedback when pressing a key, but can be overwhelming in a shared space setting such as an open office environment. Clicky switches also typically have a "bump" feeling where the key switch makes a little jump on an internal track, giving you physical feedback on your fingers as the key activates.

Cherry MX Blues are the most popular clicky switch, which required 50g of force to press the switch. MX Greens on the other hand require a firm 70g of force to be pressed.

Tactile switches are basically just clicky switches minus the clicky noise. The still have a satisfying "bump" feeling as you type on them, but they lose the clicking noise. Note that _all_ key switches still make a nontrivial amount of noise when they key is pushed all the way to the bottom of the switch, transferring force into the keyboard frame, and typically making a low thud noise.

The most popular tactile key switch is the Cherry MX Brown, which requires 45g to be pressed. There's also the MX Clear which requires 65g.

Linear switches are often marketed towards gamers because they have a completely smooth movement as you push them, no "bump" on the way down. They also lack the "click" noise.

You can choose the Cherry MX Reds for 45g, or the MX Black for 60g. I personally find both to be somewhat alarming for typing on since they are so quiet and smooth, but you may enjoy them.

Note that MX Browns and MX Blues are typically the easiest key switches to find on keyboards.

OK so o-rings aren't a switch type, but you can add them on to keycaps as a little soft "buffer" that helps absorb the force of bottoming out a keyswitch. In my opinion, the difference in feeling with o-rings installed is not that big, but the audible difference is fairly decent. These can be nice to install for an office setting if you know you are a forceful typist.
