  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a computer programmer, wannabe designer, game player, and music lover.
    In my free time, I like to make things. Below is an abridged list of things
    I've made freely available and open source.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can view

  <h3><a href="http://saikobee.github.com/lattescript/code.html">LatteScript</a></h3>
  <p>
    LatteScript is an educational programming language and environment for use
    in web browsers. You can try it out on
    <a href="http://saikobee.github.com/lattescript/code.html">GitHub</a>.
    I have blogged extensively about its development at
    <a href="http://lattescript.blogspot.com/"> the LatteScript blog</a>.
    The entire
    <a href="https://github.com/saikobee/lattescript/">source code</a>
    is available on GitHub.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/pypixel">pypixel</a></h3>
  <p>
    I learned programming using the graphics routines in QBasic. They were
    extremely basic, but perfect for a beginning programmer. I have instructed
    many people in the use of QBasic graphics, and grown fond of it. I think
    Python is one of the best programming languages for education right now,
    and that it needed a library that covered simple graphics as in QBasic.

    I spoke about this project at the SuperQuest Spring Conference in 2011.
    You can watch a video of my presentation on <a

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/npcworld/">npcworld</a></h3>
  <p>
    npcworld is an organism simulator. It simulates basic organism in a world,
    and also simulates a universe of worlds, with migration or organisms from
    one world to another. It is configurable and internally documented. You can
    <a
    href="https://github.com/downloads/saikobee/npcworld/npcworld-1.0.jar">download
    the code</a>.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/visint/">visint</a></h3>
  <p>
    visint is a volume integral visualizer. I created this as a visual learning
    aid for students in multivariable calculus. It is capable of visualizing
    integration of three different functions (but would be easily extendable to
    more) and allows the user to fly through the space or rotate/pan around
    with mouse controls. It was written in Java using pure OpenGL.

  <h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/eightbeat/">8-beat</a></h3>
  <p>
    This project is a music creation program that uses the PC speaker to make
    retro style music. It runs on Linux and Windows, and is well documented. If
    you visit the Google Code page, it has a link to the SourceForge page which
    hosts the HTML documentation for the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked closely with my musically inclined friends to produce a simple and
    useful program, since I know little about music myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    I provided extensive documentation for learning how to use the software I
    wrote, in hopes of enabling musicians to make interesting music using my
    software.
