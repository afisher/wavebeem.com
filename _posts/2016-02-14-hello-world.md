Numerous people have told me I should start a blog. I usually just talk about what's on my mind on Twitter, but Twitter is a horrible platform for a long form tutorial with code snippets, and frankly no site I've tried is actually good at this.

```javascript
// Writing is fun.
console.log('Please enjoy!');
```

I'm planning to write a post about implementing a small programming language from scratch, so look forward to that.
