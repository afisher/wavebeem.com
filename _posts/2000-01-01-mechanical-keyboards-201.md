## Introduction

- Who is this article for

This article is for people who have some familiarity with mechanical keyboards already. If not, you should read my first article, [Mechanical Keyboards 101][keebs101]. You might be considering building your own keyboard or trying out more niche hardware.

- Why not just use a pre-built?
- Nice cases, enthusiast switches, better build quality

There are a few main reasons you might want to build your own keyboard: it's a learning experience, you want to try hobbyist keyboard switches, or you want to try an obscure keyboard layout (small, split, etc).

- Rabbit hole, pricing, lack of TKL or full size options

Before we embark on this journey I do caution you that it is not without its perils. First of all, building custom keyboards and getting into niche hardware is an expensive hobby. It is also filled with FOMO (fear of missing out). Many things in this hobby are done as Group Buys (GB), where you pay to pre-order a product that may only ever get made once, if it doesn't get cancelled. Additionally, if you want to create a full size or tenkeyless keyboard, there are *very* few custom options for those form factors.

## Kits & Builds

- Soldering vs Hotswap

The first decision you need to make when you're considering building your own keyboard is whether you want to solder or not. I was initially scared of soldering, but I promise you can learn it if you want to.

You can search for soldering tutorials yourself, but at the end of the day it's using a hot stick to melt metal and glue two things together. Don't be afraid, just treat it with respect and be careful.

That being said, solder-free builds can be really nice. They are typically made using boards that come with "hot swap sockets" presinstalled. These are basically a tight fitting hole that the plugs on the keyboard switches can fit snugly into, like a cable into a port. It's less durable than soldering, but way faster if you want to change things later.
