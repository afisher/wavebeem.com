                    <p>
                        I love programming and games. I obsess over style and
                        user experience. I like functional programming and
                        solid code reviews. I contribute to open source
                        development from time to time. I live in Portland,
                        OR.

                <p>
                    iTerm is probably my second most used program after Chrome.
                    I've never been happy with the tab bar styles, so I decided
                    to build on my limited iOS development experience and dive
                    into the iTerm code base to add a new tab style. I worked
                    with the project maintainer over the course of around a
                    month to integrate my code cleanly with the existing code
                    base. See the

                    I worked a two person contract making an educational math
                    game for middle school kids. We were given a rough two
                    sentence proposal for the app as a starting point, from
                    which we designed the screens of the game, the art assets,
                    and the code.
