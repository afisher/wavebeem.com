  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/lattescript/">LatteScript</a></h3>
  <p>
  LatteScript is an educational programming language and environment for use
  in web browsers. You can try it out at
  <a href="http://saikobee.github.com/lattescript/code.html">
  http://saikobee.github.com/lattescript/code.html</a>.
  I have blogged extensively about its development at
  <a href="http://lattescript.blogspot.com/">

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/pypixel">pypixel</a></h3>
  <p>
  I learned programming using the graphics routines in QBASIC. They were
  extremely basic, but perfect for a beginning programmer. I have instructed
  many people in the use of QBASIC graphics, and grown fond of it. I think
  Python is one of the best programming languages for education right now, and
  that it needed a library that covered simple graphics as in QBASIC.

  I spoke about this project at the SuperQuest Spring Conference in 2011.
  You can watch a video of my presentation here:

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/npcworld/">npcworld</a></h3>
  <p>
  npcworld is an organism simulator. It simulates basic organism in a world,
  and also simulates a universe of worlds, with migration or organisms from one
  world to another. It is configurable and internally documented. You can
  <a href="https://github.com/downloads/saikobee/npcworld/npcworld-1.0.jar">download the code here</a>.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/visint/">visint</a></h3>
  <p>
  visint is a volume integral visualizer. I created this as a visual learning
  aid for students in multivariable calculus. It is capable of visualizing
  integration of three different functions (but would be easily extendable to
  more) and allows the user to fly through the space or rotate/pan around with
  mouse controls. It was written in Java using pure OpenGL.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/mprw/">mprw</a></h3>
  <p>
  mprw is a simple web interface for controlling an mpd server. mpd is a
  program which plays music and organizes music libraries, with many different
  interfaces. Many web interfaces already existed before I wrote this, but
  they did not meet my requirements of simplicity, beauty, and ease-of-use. I
  have not made a stable release of mprw yet, but it is completely usable in
  its current state. mprw makes use of JavaScript (including jQuery) to run
  asynchronously without page refreshes, and is optimized for Android phones
  (and laptops/desktops, of course).
  </p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/saikobee/gridpy/">gridpy</a></h3>
  <p>
  One day I wanted to mess around and make a pathfinding program. I never
  finished implementing the A* algorithm beacuse I was having so much fun
  writing a grid based graphics library I never finished the search algorithm.
  The end result was a graphics library general purpose enough that I deemed
  it worthy of open sourcing and releasing.
  </p>

  <p>
  Currently no one uses my library and few people know of it, but I desire to
  get people learning it. I would definitely use this to help teach
  programming to people.

  <h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/eightbeat/">8-beat</a></h3>
  <p>
  This project is a music creation program that uses the PC
  speaker to make retro style music. It runs on Linux and Windows, and is well
  documented. If you visit the Google Code page, it has a link to the
  SourceForge page which hosts the HTML documentation for the program.
  </p>
  <p>
  I worked closely with my musically inclined friends to produce a simple and
  useful program, since I know little about music myself.
  </p>
  <p>
  I provided extensive documentation for learning how to use
  the software I wrote, in hopes of enabling musicians to make interesting
  music using my software.
